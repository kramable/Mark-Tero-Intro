    <h1>From Wayward to Follower of Christ</h1>

    <p>
        There was a time in my life when I was far from the Lord, walking on a path of my own desires and ideas. I was consumed by worldly pursuits, believing that fulfillment would come from success, wealth, and approval from those around me. Life seemed to revolve around what I could gain, and my heart was set on temporary pleasures. Yet, deep inside, I felt an emptiness that nothing seemed to fill. I was seeking something, but I didn’t know what it was.
    </p>

    <p>
        My turning point came unexpectedly. One evening, a friend invited me to a service at <strong>Holy Spirit Fishgen Church Taytay</strong>. At first, I was hesitant. Religion felt restrictive, and I wasn’t sure I was ready to let go of my current lifestyle. But something tugged at my heart, urging me to go. Little did I know, that single decision would change my life forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        In that service, I heard the Word of God in a way I had never heard it before. The pastor spoke about a love so deep, a Savior who died to give us life. My heart was stirred, and for the first time, I felt the weight of my choices. I realized that what I had been searching for could not be found in the world; it was only in Jesus Christ. That night, I surrendered my life to Him. I asked Him to forgive me, to change me, and to fill that emptiness I had carried for so long.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since that day, my life has transformed in ways I couldn’t have imagined. I am no longer a slave to the things of this world. I live not in pursuit of material gain, but in the joy and peace of knowing <strong>God provides for all my needs</strong>. There is a fulfillment that comes from Him alone, a sense of purpose that keeps me grounded. I may not have everything the world says I need, but I know that in Christ, I am complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, I am honored to be a <strong>minister of Christ</strong>. Alongside fellow believers from our church, I go to college campuses and share the love of Christ with students. Our mission is simple: to share the truth that has set us free, to help others know that they too can experience a new life in Jesus. Holy Spirit Fishgen Church Taytay has become a home, a place where we worship, grow, and support each other in our walks with God.
    </p>

    <p>
        My prayer now is to see my family come to church, to see them find the same joy and freedom I have in Christ. I pray for them daily, trusting that in God’s timing, they will come to know Him too. It’s my heart’s deepest desire to witness them worship alongside me, to experience the love and grace of our Savior. Until that day, I remain steadfast in my faith, lifting them up in prayer and trusting that God will work in their hearts as He did in mine.
