        <h1>Mark Anthony Tero</h1>
        <h2>BSIT 3B | Student of Christ</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! My name is <strong>Mark Anthony Tero</strong>, and I am a passionate student of Christ currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT 3B)</strong>. 
            My journey in life is deeply rooted in my faith, and I strive to live according to God's purpose for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <strong>minister of Christ</strong>, I actively preach and share the Word of God, reaching out to people, especially in schools and campuses. I believe that technology and faith can work together to spread positivity and hope in today's world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from my ministry work, I have a deep interest in <strong>technology, design, and programming</strong>. I aspire to use my skills in IT to create solutions that glorify God and help people in meaningful ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            My home church is <strong>Holy Spirit Fishgen Church Taytay</strong>, where I grow spiritually and serve alongside fellow believers. My greatest prayer is for my family to join me in this journey of faith, and I trust in God's perfect timing.
